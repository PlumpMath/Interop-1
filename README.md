Interop

Managed/Native Code Interoperability Example.

This project uses my UUID generator library as the native invocation target.

The source for this library can be found at: https://github.com/bmoretz/UUID
The pre-compiled binary can be downloaded at: https://www.box.com/s/u89xfetvkef6l3mqgy74
