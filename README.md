Interop
=======

Managed/Native Code Interoperability Example.

This project uses my UUID generator library as the native invocation target.

  <ul>
    <li>The source for this library can be found at: https://github.com/bmoretz/UUID</li>
    <li>The pre-compiled binary can be downloaded at: https://www.box.com/s/u89xfetvkef6l3mqgy74</li>
  </ul>
